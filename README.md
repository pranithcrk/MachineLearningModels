# MachineLearningModels
Models i created while learning the basic fundamentals of machine learning and data using python 


HOUSINGPRICEUSA - first ML application i did using the linear regression model and got a score of 91% which is pretty good given the volume of the data set. Data was initially very raw with many null values, text columns and features which had no contribution in predicating the final prices. SO I had to preprocess and clean the data and then visualize it to get the relation between the features and the prices. It turned out to be linear, so i used linear regression model form sklearn lib of python 
Skills used- Basic python programming , pandas , numpy , seaborn , matplot , sklearn etc
