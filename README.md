# MachineLearningModels
Models i created while learning the basic fundamentals of machine learning and data using python 


1.HOUSINGPRICEUSA - first ML application i did using the linear regression model and got a score of 91% which is pretty good given the volume of the data set. Data was initially very raw with many null values, text columns and features which had no contribution in predicating the final prices. SO I had to preprocess and clean the data and then visualize it to get the relation between the features and the prices. It turned out to be linear, so i used linear regression model form sklearn lib of python 
Skills used- Basic python programming , pandas , numpy , seaborn , matplotlib , sklearn etc 

2.Breast Cancer Detection - Used Kneighbors classifier and Support Vector Machine's SVC to predict whether the cancer caused is malignant or benign. Dataset was acquired from uci's datasets for machine learning. Initially data was crude has to go through various preprocessing steps , and was later visualized by plotting coorelational matrix to identity the more important features for predication and dropping those not required. After fitting the model(training set) to both the algorithms accuracy /score was calculated on the test data test
SVC -0.6642857142857143   Kneighbors-0.9785714285714285 stating that Kneighbors was more appropriate to use in this particular case
